    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-test-author to design, add, or update PHP tests for the requested behavior.
        Keep tests deterministic, concise, and focused on observable outcomes.
        Follow modern PHPUnit practices, including attributes and data providers,
        and use only directives supported by the current PHPUnit/PHP version.
        Place tests in the correct suite folder (Unit, Integration, Feature),
        selecting the lowest level that fully validates the requirement.
        After writing tests, run the existing PHP quality skills in order:
        $php-complexity-refactor, $php-naming-normalizer, $php-styling,
        $php-documenter, $php-attribution, and $php-quality-remediator.
        Then run composer test or the relevant PHPUnit command for the changed
        file/method and return the standard outcome contract.
