    short_description: Improve PHP naming for human readability and domain clarity with anti-churn safeguards
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-naming-normalizer to improve PHP naming based on human readability and domain clarity.
        Apply only high-confidence, task-scoped renames that meet the rename threshold.
        Do not perform broad or preference-based refactors.
        If broader renaming would be beneficial, return approval-required with a proposed plan.
        Run tests if executable code is modified and always return the standard outcome contract.
