    short_description: Keep DTO and VO contracts explicit, stable, and fail-fast
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-data-contract-normalizer to review DTO and VO contract
        normalization behavior. Keep DTO fromArray/toArray mapping direct,
        keep VO from/make flows explicit, and preserve public key/value
        contracts. Use the Normalizer facade from VOs rather than calling
        Types normalizers directly. Preserve context pass-through where the
        normalizer supports or depends on it, and do not drop context
        parameters just to satisfy facade signature warnings. If signatures look
        inconsistent, verify installed dependencies before changing behavior.
        Do not add hidden coercion that masks invalid upstream usage; allow PHP
        type enforcement and existing validation exceptions to fail fast where
        applicable. Keep constructor visibility/finality changes minimal and
        driven by
        quality-gate requirements or explicit architectural direction.
        Run tests when executable PHP changes are made and return the standard
        outcome contract.
