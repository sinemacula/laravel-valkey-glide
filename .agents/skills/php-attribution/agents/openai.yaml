    short_description: Add high-signal PHP attributes to clarify intent and improve correctness
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-attribution to add appropriate PHP-native attributes to modified
        code where they provide clear, defensible value.
        Apply attributes conservatively, only when intent is unambiguous and behavior
        is already implied by the existing code.
        Do not introduce new dependencies, configuration changes, or broad attribute
        sweeps without explicit approval.
        Keep changes scoped, avoid churn, preserve runtime behavior, and return the
        standard outcome contract.
