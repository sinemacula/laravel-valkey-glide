    short_description: Enforce clear, concise, and consistent PHP documentation with anti-churn safeguards
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-documenter to ensure PHP documentation and comments are complete, accurate,
        concise, and human-readable across all modified code.
        First run composer check -- --all --no-cache --fix so deterministic formatting and
        docblock normalization run before manual documentation edits.
        Then add missing documentation, simplify overly verbose descriptions, and enforce strict
        formatting rules without introducing documentation churn.
        Preserve existing attribution and custom comments unless changes are required.
        Run tests if executable code is modified and always return the standard outcome contract.
