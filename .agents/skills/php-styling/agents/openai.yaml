    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-styling to apply deterministic PHP style and formatting rules
        to modified code only.
        Enforce naming style, layout, spacing, and readability-focused formatting
        without introducing semantic or domain-level changes.
        Keep changes scoped to the task, avoid churn, and preserve runtime behavior.
        Run tests if executable code is modified and always return the standard
        outcome contract.
