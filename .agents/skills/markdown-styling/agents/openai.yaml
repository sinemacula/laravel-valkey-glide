    short_description: Enforce consistent Markdown style with 120-char prose reflow
    default_prompt: >
        Use $markdown-styling to normalize Markdown files by removing duplicate
        content, unwrapping and rewrapping prose at 120 characters, and enforcing
        consistent heading, list, spacing, and terminology style without changing
        meaning. Never reflow fenced code block content.
