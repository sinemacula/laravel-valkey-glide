    short_description: Run deterministic PHP quality checks and remediate code-level findings
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-quality-remediator to run composer check -- --all --no-cache --fix and remediate any reported
        PHP quality findings by fixing code first and preserving behavior.
        Prefer minimal, scoped changes and reuse existing remediation skills where appropriate.
        Do not change or suppress static analysis configuration without explicit approval.
        If remediation is potentially breaking, large in scope, or blocked, return approval-required.
        Always return the standard outcome contract.
