    short_description: Resolve objective PHP complexity findings or flag AI-identified maintainability risks with approval gating
    default_prompt: >
        Use $php-complexity-refactor to address PHP complexity.
        If objective tool-reported thresholds are exceeded, apply focused, behavior-preserving refactors and run targeted tests.
        If complexity is identified through AI judgment only, do not modify code and return an approval-required outcome with recommendations.
        Always return the standard outcome contract.
